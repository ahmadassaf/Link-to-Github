First of all, it's a browser extension. Once installed, it allows you to navigate through projects on GitHub.com efficiently.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This Google Chrome extension allows you to navigate across files and packages on GitHub.com with ease. It works really well for JavaScript e.g. `package.json` `bower.json` `ES2015 import` and good old `CommonJS` statements. Also PHP `composer.json` is supported. Many [other languages](https://github.com/octo-linker/chrome-extension/labels/Add%20support) will be added soon.
=======
Most projects consist of many files and third party dependencies. Files are referencing other files and / or dependencies by language specific statements like `include` or `require`. Dependencies are most likely declared in a file called manifest e.g. `package.json` or `Gemfile`. The OctoLinker browser extensions makes these references clickable. No more copy and search.
